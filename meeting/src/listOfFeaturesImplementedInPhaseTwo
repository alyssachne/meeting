that fit the requirements of their event.
5.Allow the system to support additional user requests (e.g. dietary restrictions, accessibility requirements) where
organizers can tag a request as "pending" or "addressed". All organizers see the same list of requests, so if one tags a

statistics to make this option as complicated as the other ones on this list.
    -All organizers can see a summary of statistic: which event is most popular, enrollment rate of each event.
